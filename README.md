# Mini Games

This project will be used to learn how to use the Godot engine.

The Godot project currently consist of a simple number guessing mini-game just to get used to the engine. It will probably contain other mini-games to learn more and more about the engine but these are not meant to be played.

This repo is more of a learning tool than a release-ready game
